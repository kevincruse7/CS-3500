Changes made from Assignment 2:
- Added extra check in doPyramidCardsSumToThirteen in BasicPyramidSolitaire to account for case
  where top level card is a king
- Decomposed toString in PyramidSolitaireTextualView into several helper methods to improve
  readability
- Fixed toString in PyramidSolitaireTextualView so that an empty draw pile is displayed as "Draw:"
  and not "Draw: .  , .  , ."
